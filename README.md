# Tetris - First Try

This is my first attempt at creating a Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows you to play a basic version of Tetris, where you can control falling tetrominoes to create complete lines and score points.

## Features

- Simple user interface
- Score tracking
- Start/Pause button to control the game
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For the structure of the game
- CSS: For styling the game elements and layout
- JavaScript: For the game logic and interactivity

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the controls to move and rotate the tetrominoes.
4. Try to complete as many lines as possible!

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RavshanSean/Tetris-First-Try.git
